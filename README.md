# SolarButton-1stTask

here is a quick explanation what you should do  
Counter Task 

*In visual studio code - open a folder, create your files. Css, html and your js files 
* Aim of the task - Create a button every time its pressed it should update a span with the amount of times its been clicked, 
the btn should also switch between two colours 
 (Simple I know)

* requirements 

- Separate js file for your button, 
- separate js file for your text (label/span),
- meaning the button functions is only in the button js, the function to update the counter is in the counter span file 
  (so you are going to play around with callback functions using bind and call )
- the btn and counter js files must be in IIFE (google is your friend )  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE
		(function (root) {//your code}(window));
- you can have a main to call the function that creates your DOM elements 
the css and all the other stuff is up to you
